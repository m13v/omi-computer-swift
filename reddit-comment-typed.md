We built exactly this kind of system at Omi (open-source desktop AI app) — our CLAUDE.md has skills for Sentry log lookup, PostHog analytics queries, and Firebase access. When a user emails a bug report, a Claude Code agent spins up with full codebase context, investigates the logs, traces the code path, and produces a fix plan before any dev opens the terminal. The \"passive context beats active tools\" point is spot on. We put our entire debugging toolkit directly into CLAUDE.md skills rather than making Claude figure out which tool to use. The result: bug triage went from hours to minutes. Demo of the full pipeline: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qyyssy/"

While some people found OP's technical advice useful, the top-voted comments are dragging OP for their arrogant "I've solved it and you're all wrong" tone. The fact that OP's account is three days old and they admitted to using Claude to write the post didn't help, with many calling it "AI-generated slop."

                              - paragraph [ref=e3288]: It’s trying to appeal to the people who want to get into the water, but don’t want to get cold.

                              - paragraph [ref=e3291]: If you want to use the tool, take the time and read the manual. Don’t just grab it then bitch when it hurts you.
                              - paragraph [ref=e3292]: I’m a civil engineer. I had to start from square fucking one when it came to coding (I’m a homelabber but no formal CS education beyond a single course on Matlab), and in my free time, at night. But I did. And now I’m here, cranking out insane shit with agentic coding. There is no teleport from A to B, you gotta walk.

For stuff it cant, I personally think doc maintenance is the best way to go. Some docs I essentially wrap in skills, where the docs encode a philosophy or approach, and the the skill includes some small set of actionable instruction."
                                    - paragraph [ref=e4158]: so like "when you see x do y", that should be obvious based on existing code. if its not, fix existing code. If claude doesn't realize that on a given task, give it an example of what it should do in the codebase. That is by far the most powerful thing you can do. If you constantly need to give it examples for a job, try to figure out whats going wrong in planning where its not looking at surrounding code (because it should as a baseline)
                                    - paragraph [ref=e4159]: An example of a doc for me is my testing philosophy, i think claude over tests. Im fine with over testing during development, i just dont want to commit the excess tests. So i have a skill i run before commits to load my testing philosophy, and pull back on tests. This works _really_ well for me, but ymmv. I think this type of intervention is less straightforward, there are a lot of ways to approach it that will work differently for different people.
